Asset bundles are custom assets grouped together, generated via unity and contain prefabs, these prefabs can be used within mods to provide functionality, and the visuals to a mod.
To create an asset bundle, you must first install the unity plugin [Asset Bundle Browser](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/AssetBundles-Browser)

This allows you to build your unity prefabs into an asset bundle which can be utilised by your mod via code, instructions are found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetBundles-Browser.html)
