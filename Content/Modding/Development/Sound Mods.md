Sound replacement mods use [[CustomSounds]] and [[LCSoundTool]] while sound addition mods have to be done manually
Replacing a sound with the two APIs is as simple as renaming your chosen `.wav/.mp3/.ogg` file to the same as found in Lethal Company's files then placing it in the `\CustomSounds\` directory located at the top level of your [[Publishing|file hierarchy]]

The list of audio files can be obtained by using [AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper)
